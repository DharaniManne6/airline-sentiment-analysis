# ✈️ Airline Sentiment Analysis

## 📝 Overview
Analyze airline tweets to predict sentiment: **Positive 🙂, Negative 😡, Neutral 😐** using **ML & Deep Learning**. Includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

This project helps understand customer feedback from social media and practices real-world text analysis and modeling.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Data Handling & Analysis:** pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud  
- **Text Processing:** nltk (stopwords, tokenization, lemmatization)  
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, metrics)  
- **Deep Learning:** tensorflow / keras (LSTM, RNN)  
- **Optional:** ace-tools-open (interactive DataFrame display)  

---

## 🔧 Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** – Remove irrelevant columns, handle missing values, remove empty tweets.  
2. **EDA & Visualization** – Plot tweet lengths, sentiment distribution, word clouds.  
3. **Text Preprocessing** – Lowercase, remove punctuation/stopwords, lemmatization.  
4. **Feature Extraction** – Bag of Words & TF-IDF.  
5. **Machine Learning Models** – Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes.  
6. **Deep Learning Models** – LSTM & RNN.  
7. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.  
8. **Misclassified Examples** – Inspect errors for model improvement.

## 💡 Example Tweets
- `"I love the service on Delta!"` → Positive 🙂  
- `"My flight was delayed for 5 hours."` → Negative 😡  
- `"I am flying tomorrow."` → Neutral 😐
